The `root()` function is useful for taking the square root, but we know we can already do that with `sqrt()`. So why is it useful?

```{r}
library(powers)
```


How about taking the cube root!

```{r}
root(64, 3)
```

You can take the cube root of a vector of multiple values as well.

```{r}
my_values <- c(125, 216)
root(my_values, 3)
```

Any higher degree root will work too, whatever you need!

```{r}
root(243, 5)
```

*Have fun out there with `root()`!*
